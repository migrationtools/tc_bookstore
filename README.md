This is the target tomcat deployable web application.
We have a parallel application of the same bookstore app that is targeting weblogic.  
This app can be found at:
https://github.com/migrationtools/wl_bookstore

This application serves as the end state the weblogic deployable version strives to migrate to and can be used as a reference as we go through and configure the migration rules.
As we add more features to the weblogic version, we will continue to enhance this application to match the feature on tomcat deployable.
This serves as the end state and will help us when we start automation of the migration rules moving the application from weblogic to tomcat.
